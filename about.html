    <h1>About</h1> 
        <h2>Objective:</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this document is to explain my approach to completing the following assignment:</p>

        <p class="quote">“Please write a program that generates a list of 10,000 numbers in random order each time it is run. Each number in the list must be unique and be between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).”</p>

        <h2>Analysis:</h2>

        <p>After careful consideration and extensive research on the subject, I found many seemingly viable solutions to this problem. The naïve approach would be to write a loop that generates random numbers from 1 through 10,000 and check to see whether or not they had already been generated.  If not, add them to an output list.  The main problem with this is efficiency.</p>

        <p>This approach would be quick at first.  However, it would become progressively more difficult to find a number that had not already been selected.  After half of the numbers had been used, the odds are less than 50% of finding a good number.  The odds of finding the final number in a list of 10,000 numbers are 1 in 10,000.  This approach would take a long time to complete, which would provide a very poor user experience for the client.</p>

        <p>My first goal was to ensure the accurate generation of the list of numbers.  I wanted to make sure the list I created was completely random, with a uniform distribution, in the shortest time possible.</p>

        <p>I realized that, since the numbers are unique and finite, what I ultimately had was the equivalent of a huge deck of cards.  Therefore, I decided to use a shuffle approach.  I used the Fisher-Yates Shuffle, because it produces a perfectly even distribution of possible solution sets.  (Other shuffles can be biased towards some distributions, and are, therefore, not uniform.)</p>
        
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        
        <p>My solution was to use a “Durstenfeld Shuffle” algorithm. A well-known shuffle algorithm is the “Fisher-Yates Shuffle”, which was developed in 1938. This algorithm randomizes a set of increasing numbers. In 1964, Richard Durstenfeld published an algorithm that was based on the Fisher-Yates shuffle, but was optimized for computer use. The Durstenfeld Shuffle is much faster than the Fisher-Yates Shuffle. </p>
        
        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        
        <p>I am presenting the random/shuffled numbers in a table. The order of the numbers is from left to right, top to bottom.</p>
        
        <p>I added pagination, in order to minimize the screen usage. The number of columns and pages will vary, depending on the screen size.
        
        <p>This application is optimized for responsive sites and mobile applications. When you resize your desktop browser, the table will adjust accordingly.</p>
        
        <p>NOTE – Once you go below 800 pixels wide, the application interprets this as a medium tablet device. Sine you cannot resize tablets and phones, you will have to refresh the browser in order to adjust the table size.</p>
